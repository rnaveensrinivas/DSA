# Introduction

The way we approach programming has evolved with advancements in computing technology, such as faster processors, high-speed networks, and large memory capacities. Despite these changes, the **core principle of computer science** remains unchanged: *using computers to solve problems*.

# What is Computer Science?

**Computer science** is the study of problems, problem-solving, and solutions. It focuses on **algorithms**, which are step-by-step instructions to solve problems. Some problems are **computable** (solvable with an algorithm), while others are not, and computer science addresses both types. Thus, it can be defined as the study of both solvable and unsolvable problems.

**Computer** is just a tool that facilitates computer scientists, solutions are considered independent from the machine.

**Abstraction** is crucial in computer science, distinguishing the **logical perspective** (how users interact with systems) from the **physical perspective** (the technical details). For example, a driver uses a car's interface (steering, braking) without knowing how the engine works, while a mechanic understands the inner workings. Similarly, users interact with software without knowing the underlying code, while computer scientists and programmers handle those details.

In **procedural abstraction**, like Python’s math module, users can perform tasks (e.g., calculating square roots) without understanding the implementation, relying on the function’s interface. This is a **black box** view, where users only need to know the inputs and outputs, not the internal details.

# What is Programming?

**Programming** is the process of encoding an **algorithm** into a **programming language** so it can be executed by a computer. Programming requires a well-defined solution, as no program can exist without an algorithm. While computer science is not the study of programming, programming is an essential tool for representing and implementing solutions.

**Algorithms** specify the **data** and **steps** needed to solve a problem, and programming languages provide the constructs to represent both. These constructs include:  
1. **Control constructs**: For sequential processing, decision-making (selection), and repetitive control (iteration).  
2. **Data types**: To interpret binary data and associate meaningful operations (e.g., arithmetic for integers). Data types provide an abstraction over binary.

While primitive data types like integers form the building blocks for algorithms, complex problems require mechanisms to manage and simplify the inherent complexity of solutions. Programming languages and tools are vital for tackling this challenge.

# Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?

Studying **data structures** and **abstract data types (ADTs)** is essential for managing problem complexity. **Abstraction** helps computer scientists focus on the "big picture" by modeling problems in ways that align data manipulation with the problem's context, rather than its implementation details.

Key concepts:  
- **Data abstraction**: Describes data and allowable operations at a logical level, independent of how they are implemented. This encapsulation hides implementation details from the user, a process known as **information hiding**.  
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**: Provide a high-level interface for interacting with data and operations, while their implementation details remain hidden.  
- **Data structures**: Physical implementations of ADTs using programming constructs and primitive data types.

This separation between an ADT's interface and implementation ensures flexibility, allowing programmers to modify implementation (since there will usually be many differnet ways to implement) details without affecting how users interact with the data (**implementation-independent**). This independence supports efficient problem-solving and adaptable system design.

# Why Sutdy Algorithms?

Studying **algorithms** is essential for developing problem-solving skills, recognizing patterns, and evaluating solutions effectively. Exposure to diverse algorithms helps computer scientists tackle new challenges by applying learned techniques to similar problems.

Key points:  
- **Efficiency comparison**: Algorithms may vary in speed, memory usage, or resource efficiency. Learning analysis techniques enables comparison based on algorithm characteristics, independent of the program or hardware.  
- **Intractable problems**: Some problems lack feasible solutions or require excessive time/resources. Identifying these is crucial to focus efforts effectively.  
- **Trade-offs**: Evaluating and balancing trade-offs, such as speed vs. memory usage, is a critical part of algorithm selection.  
- **Iteration**: The process of finding solutions and determining their quality is repeated frequently in computer science.

Ultimately, studying algorithms equips us to identify efficient solutions, analyze their effectiveness, and adapt to increasingly complex problems.
